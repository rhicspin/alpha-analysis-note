\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

At the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) measurements of the proton beam
polarization are carried out by inserting an ultra thin carbon ribbon in the
beam and registering the scattered carbon ions with silicon detectors. The
polarization value reported by the proton-carbon polarimeters strongly depends
on the correct measurement of the energy of the recoil products by the
detectors. In this note we present a study of the silicon detector response to
$\alpha$-particles employed to calibrate the detectors.

\end{abstract}


\section{Motivation}

The RHIC polarimetry is based on the measurement of the recoil from elastic
scattering of the proton beam on a fixed target in the Coulomb nuclear
interference (CNI) energy regime. In this study we focus on the four p-Carbon
polarimeters with ultra thin carbon targets which can be briefly moved into the
beam. In the collider the polarization of each proton beam can be measured
independently by two p-Carbon polarimeters installed in the ``yellow'' and
``blue'' accelerator rings.

During the 2013 run we observed significant changes in the gain in some of the
silicon detectors. This change of $\lesssim 20~\%$ is worrisome and may cause
significant systematic change in the reported polarization values due to a steep
slope in the $p$-Carbon analysing power within the energy range of interest.


\section{Measurement and Results}

The detectors produced by the BNL instrumentation group have 12 one-millimeter
silicon strips operating under the nominal bias voltage of 110~V. The detector
gain is normally monitored by taking calibration runs when there is no beam in
the machine. Starting April 3, 2013 the calibration runs were taken
automatically at the end of every RHIC store immediately after the beam dump.
This approach gave us the ability to track the changes in detector properties at
a more precise level than before. Although we primarily focus on the Run~13 data
we also analyzed the $\alpha$-calibration data from Run~12. The results for the
limited statistics can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_run12}. The
analysis of the data was performed with the {\tt cnipol}
package~\cite{cnipol_code}.


\subsection{Energy calibration with $\alpha$-particles}

\end{wrapfigure}

For the purpose of polarization measurement the silicon strip detectors
mentioned above are used as calorimeters which measure the energy of the slow
carbons ions coming from the fixed target. The energy of the recoil particles
can be reconstructed from either the amplitude or the integral of the signal
registered by the detector. In general we observe a very good correlation
between the amplitude and the integral of the collected charge therefore, our
choice of the former is only set by historical reasons. In the current setup our
ability to calibrate the detector response to carbon ions with known energies is
very limited. For the energy calibration purposes we use low intensity
\americium{} and \gadolinium{} radioactive sources emitting $\alpha$-particles
with fixed energies of $E_{\text{Am}} = 5.486~\text{MeV}$ and $E_{\text{Gd}} =
3.271~\text{MeV}$ respectively. The sources are put in the vacuum in the direct
acceptance of the detectors. Currently two polarimeters, Y1D and B1U, are
supplied with only \americium{} sources, while the other two, Y2U and B2D, have,
in addition, \gadolinium{} sources installed inside the polarimeter chambers.
Prior to 2012 only the americium sources were available for calibration.

The energy of the $\alpha$-particles is few times higher than that of the carbon
ions reaching the detectors. We reduce the readout signal by means of
attenuators by a factor of 5 to bring it back to the range where the amplitude
can be digitized by the readout electronics. In the absence of the beam we
observe clean peaks from the radioactive sources as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:atten_distrib_nominal}. The peaks are fit with a gaussian
function to find the mean of the distribution. The nominal detector gain is then
defined as a ratio of the peak position, $\mu_{\text{Am}}$, to the
$E_{\text{Am}}$ energy. This definition completely ignores possible energy
losses outside of the active detector region. This limitation can be overcome to
some extent by using a second $\alpha$-source. The slope of the calibration
curve in this case connecting the two sources would effectively take into
account the unresponsive region of the detector. This region is referred to as
the {\it dead layer}, and we discuss it in the next section.

Information about gadolinium peak can tell us more about our calibration curve.
For instance we can take gadolinium gain and linear two-point (americium and
gadolinium) fit slope and compare them to americium gain
(Figure~\ref{fig:gain_relations}).

\subsection{Effective dead layer}

Our model for silicon detector assumes that there is a layer where our detector
has zero response as a calorimeter, i.e. the dead layer. Adding a gadolinium alpha
source to the setup allows us to put one more calibration point on our
calibration curve. Using americium and gadolinium points we can estimate
the thickness of this layer.

The energy where the linear fit intersects the horizontal axis gives us an
estimate for the initial energy of incident alpha particles which would deposit
all of their energy in the dead layer. While this quantity by itself can be used
to monitor the stability of the dead layer over time, we also present the result
in microns. For this we assume that the gain values for both calibration points
are equal and we write:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\mu_{Am}}{E_{Am} - E^\text{DL}_{Am}} = \frac{\mu_{Gd}}{E_{Gd} - E^\text{DL}_{Gd}},
\label{eq:gain_equality}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\mu_\text{Am}$ and $\mu_\text{Gd}$ are the mean values of the
alpha peaks measured in ADC units, $E_\text{Am}$ and $E_\text{Gd}$ are the
incident energies of $\alpha$-particles, and $E^\text{DL}_{Am}$ and
$E^\text{DL}_{Gd}$ are the energy losses in the dead layer for the respective
alpha sources. The rate at which $\alpha$-particles loose their energy in the
detector changes with the penetration depth. As the dead layer is relatively
thin we can assume that the particles do not loose a significant fraction of
their initial energy and the stopping power is approximately constant over this
range. With a linear approximation for the total losses we have:

\begin{equation}
E^\text{DL}_\text{Am} \simeq x_\text{DL} \lambda_\text{Am} \qquad
E^\text{DL}_\text{Gd} \simeq x_\text{DL} \lambda_\text{Gd}
\label{eq:linear_loss}
\end{equation}

\noindent
with values for the stopping power $\lambda_\text{Am} = $ and $\lambda_\text{Gd}
= $ taken from \cite{astar_database}. Combining (\ref{eq:gain_equality}) and
(\ref{eq:linear_loss}) we obtain the following formula for the size of the dead
layer:

\begin{equation}
x_{DL} = \frac{\mu_{Gd} E_{Am} - \mu_{Am} E_{Gd}}{\mu_{Gd}\lambda_{Am} - \mu_{Am}\lambda_{Gd}}
\label{eq:x_dl}
\end{equation}

The thickness of the dead layer thus extracted from the all available
calibration runs in Run~13 are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:x_dl}. The average size
of the dead layer is estimated to be within 1 to 1.3 $\mu m$.

\subsection{Bias current}

% TODO: write something about how out bias current varies over time

On figures~\ref{fig:gain_relations},\ref{fig:e_dl} and \ref{fig:x_dl} there are few measurements
before and after the beam session showing much lower spread. This looks to be a result of some
parameter variation due to beam pickup.

One of the work parameters of our silicon detector that we measure is a bias current -- current
constantly flowing through detector (in this case -- set of 12 strips). Current was measured
for each of the six silicon detectors on all polarimeters, measurements were taken each five
minutes. Values lie mostly in range from $-30$ to $0$~$\mu A$. It was interesting to see how
this current affects calibration characteristics of our detector. For example, it is known 
that higher bias voltage should decrease size of depleted zone, i.e. decrease size of dead layer.
On our plots (Fig.~\ref{fig:bc_vs_xdl}) we see some weak correlation between dead layer size and bias
current.

\newcommand\bcvsxdllabel{Bias current versus dead layer size dependency}

\caption{\bcvsxdllabel}
\label{fig:bc_vs_xdl}
\end{figure}

Much stronger correlation is seen when we compare bias current with gain
(Fig.~\ref{fig:bc_vs_gain}).  Bias current during polarization measurement can
differ from the bias current in the time of alpha measurement, so correction to
gain value should be applied.

Additional correlation seen on plots \ref{bc_vs_gain-b1u} and
\ref{bc_vs_gain-y1d} corresponds to special set of measurements with varied bias
voltage.

\subsection{Linearity of amplifiers}

The signal generated in the detector propagates through several stages of
amplification. The linearity of the downstream amplifiers can be simply checked
by attenuating the signal in a place on the signal path preceding the
amplification, and then compare the reduced final amplitude with the expected
one. The shaper boards have a resistive divider with a multiplexer controlled by
software settings. For normal polarization measurements of sub-MeV carbon ions
the on-board attenuator is set to 1, i.e. no signal attenuation. During regular
alpha measurements the attenuator is set to $1/5$. In this study we check the
other two attenuator settings of $1/10$ and $1/3$. The alpha peaks obtained with
these attenuator settings are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:atten_distrib} and the
mean values corresponding to the gaussian fits are listed in
Table~\ref{table:atten}. Note that with the attenuator setting of $1/3$ the Am
peak ends up in the overflow bin as the events are outside of the detector
dynamic range. The cumulative effect of a possible non-linearity in the
amplified signal is checked by using the trivial relation in which the mean of
the peak is expected to scale with the attenuator settings:

\begin{equation}
\lambda_1/\lambda_2 = \mu_1/ \mu_2.
\label{eq:atten_linearity}
\end{equation}


\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{The mean positions of the \americium and \gadolinium $\alpha$-peaks
with different attenuator settings.}

\begin{tabular}{clrr}
\toprule
Attenuation $\lambda$ & Alpha Run Id      & Am Mean, ADC      & Gd Mean, ADC \\
\midrule
$\frac{1}{10}$  & \small{atten\_1\_over\_10.yel2.alpha0}  & $77.0\pm0.7$      & $44.2\pm0.4$ \\
\addlinespace
$\frac{1}{5}$   & \small{13\_310713.yel2.alpha0}          & $154.9\pm2.7$     & $88.9\pm1.5$ \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\label{table:atten}
\end{table}

\noindent
This effect relative to one of the attenuator settings is then simply defined as
$\Delta l = \frac{\lambda_1 \mu_2}{\lambda_2 \mu_1} - 1$. For the three pairs
of measurements we calculate very small deviations from the linear
equation~(\ref{eq:atten_linearity}).

\begin{equation}
\frac{154.9}{77.0 \times 2} - 1 = 0.6\%
\qquad
\frac{88.9}{44.0 \times 2} - 1 = 0.6\%
\qquad
\frac{149.4 \times 3}{88.9 \times 5} - 1 = 0.8\%

\section{Conclusions}

Based on the analysis presented in this note we establish that the changes in
the bias currents in out silicon detectors heavily depend on the beam activity
in the RHIC. At the moment, we do not see that the bias current correlates with
the beam intensity but in further studies we plan to investigate if other beam
or machine parameters have direct impact on the detectors.

We observe a strong correlation between the gain and the bias current.

The presence of the two $\alpha$-sources in the polarimeters allowed us to find
a correction for the effective detector gain by taking into account the energy
lost in the dead layer. We find this correction to be at $\approx 5\%$ level
with respect to the nominal calibration procedure with one radioactive source.
In addition, we estimate the thickness of the effective dead layer to be
$\approx 1.1\mu m$. This number significantly disagrees with the value extracted
from the nominal ``banana'' fit to the carbon data where the dead layer is
estimated to be $\approx 0.15\mu m$. A possible explanation for this discrepancy
is that we overestimate the dead layer thickness as measured with
$\alpha$-particles by not taking into account the extra material covering the
source.

Comparing the detector gains measured before and after the beam time we conclude
that there was no significant radiation damage of the detectors.

A similar study has been performed for the 2012 data. The corresponding plots
can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_run12}.
